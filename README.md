Weinberg, Gabriel

**Traction = growth** 

## **Traction channels
(customer acquisition channels)

Startups get traction through nineteen different channels:

**Viral Marketing**
= encouraging your users to **refer** other users.

**Public relations**
= the art of getting your name out there via traditional media outlets like newspapers, magazines and TV.

**Unconventional PR**
= doing something exceptional (like publicity stunts) to draw media attention.

**Search engine marketing (SEM)** 
= advertising to consumers searching on Google and other search engines

**Social and Display Ads**
= advertising on popular sites like reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and hundreds of other niche sites

**Offline Ads**
= TV spots, radio commercials, billboards, infomercials, newspaper and magazine ads, as well as flyers and other local advertisements.

**Search Engine Optimization**
= making sure your website shows up for key search results.

**Content Marketing**
= using eg. blogs to get traction. 

**Email Marketing**
= one of the best ways to convert prospects while retaining and monetizing existing ones.

**Engineering as Marketing** 
= using engineering resources eg. building micro-sites, developing widgets, and creating free tools that drive thousands of leads, to acquire customers.

**Targeting Blogs**
= targeting niche blogs early on to acquire customers

**Business Development**
= creating strategic relationships that benefit both your startup and your partner.

**Sales**
= creating processes to directly exchange product for dollars

**Affiliate Programs**
= get your products promoted via affiliate programs to reach hundreds of thousands of customers in a cost-effective way.

**Existing Platforms**
= focusing your growth efforts on a mega-platform like Facebook, Twitter, or an App Store 

**Trade Shows** 
= a chance for companies in specific industries to show off their latest products.

**Offline Events**
= sponsoring or running offline events – from small meetups to large conferences

**Speaking Engagements**
= leverage a speaking event, give an awesome talk and grow your startup’s profile at such speaking gigs.

**Community Building**
= forming passionate communities around your products.

Tips:
- Until you start running tests, it’s difficult to tell which channel is the best one for you right now.
- You have natural tendencies (bias) toward or against certain traction channels. Think about which traction channels are you biased for and which traction channels are you biased against.
- Get one channel working that your competitors dismiss, and you can grow rapidly while they languish.
